            <h3>Roscoe Pound Serves as Drum Major</h3>
            <p>One of the more famous members of the Cadet Band during its early days was Nathan Roscoe Pound, who became the Dean of the Nebraska Law School and later Dean of Harvard Law School. Although Pound could not play a musical instrument, he served as the band's Drum Major beginning in 1882 when he was a student at the University's prep school. He continued in that capacity until his graduation from the University in 1888.</p>

            <h3>Band plays first football "halftime" show</h3>
            <p>In the 1880's the University did not have an athletic department, so the band's association with sports began with an informal University baseball team. Providing entertainment at these games was the band's only contact with athletics until Roscoe Pound began to campaign for a football program at the University. With the help of drummer Albert Troyer, a team was organized and on Thanksgiving Day, 1880, the first official Nebraska football game was played against a team from the Omaha Y.M.C.A., with the band providing musical entertainment from the sidelines. The idea of halftime shows did not evolve until later.</p>

            <p>Lt. John J. Pershing came to the University as military commander in 1891 and helped to change the destiny of the Nebraska band. Before Lt. Pershing came on the scene, the band stood in formation and played while the cadets marched. However, Pershing required the band to march as well as play during military drill. The cadets and band won several honors for their precision and began to draw large crowds at their weekly reviews. Pershing was a sports fan and suggested that the cadets and band put on a review during a football game. This first "halftime" show was performed in November of 1893 and became an annual event. John J. “Black Jack” Pershing went on to become General of the Armies of the United States and the overall American Commander in Europe during World War I.</p>

            <h3>Band Performs at St. Louis World's Fair</h3>
            <p>In 1904 the band took on the ambitious undertaking of a trip to the Louisiana Purchase Centennial Exposition, more familiarly known as the St. Louis World's Fair. About one hundred cadets from the University in addition to the forty-member Band made the two week jaunt in June. All expenses were paid by the Exposition which had invited military organizations and bands from all over the country to attend. Reports from observers indicated that, while there were better military units present, "no other musical organization equaled the performances of the Cadet Band from Nebraska."</p>

            <h3>"Dear Old Nebraska U"</h3>
            <p>"Dear Old Nebraska U" was written in 1923 by Harry Pecha ('class of '24.) The story goes that he wrote the song while at an ROTC Camp in Ft. Snelling, MN that summer. There is evidence to suggest however that it's more accurate that Pecha "borrowed" the song from an older tune from the University of Chicage entitled "I'm Strong for Chicago." Similar tunes also exist at the Universities of Florida, Kentucky and Toledo, indicating that the Chicago original was ripe for imitation. Originally in 3/4 time, Band Director Billy Quick arranged "No Place," as it almost immediately became known, in 2/4 to facilitate its use on the march. Sometime after his graduation in 1924, Pecha offered to give "No Place" to the University in return for two lifetime football tickets. But, in one of those fateful decisions of history, the University declined. The decision came from the Board of Intercollegiate Athletics. Board member John K. Selleck remembered it as, "an unfortunate decision…" The University only recently acquired full rights to the piece from the estate of Michael Jackson.</p>

            <h3>John Philip Sousa visits and composes the University of Nebraska March</h3>
            <p>On November 1, 1927 John Philip Sousa visited Lincoln and presented the Band a Silver Cup for “Distinguished Collegiate Rating” at a concert at the NU Coliseum. At that time the War Department would bestow an award known as the Blue Star Rating to units that rated excellent in their corps area of inspection. The Nebraska ROTC Band won this rating frequently and had scores ranking among the highest in the nation. Sousa had an interest in developing school music programs, and wished to recognize Nebraska’s achievement.</p>

            <p>Three months later, Sousa wrote a march “For the Faculty and Students of the University of Nebraska.” In a letter to Chancellor Burnett, Sousa said of it, “My friends seem to like it very much and I sincerely hope the march will appeal to you and your students and will be worthy of your fine Band which is, without a doubt, one of the finest college Bands in America.”</p>

            <h3>Band Day (sort of! we'll want to note multiple dates)</h3>
            <p>The massed band extravaganza known as Band Day had its origins at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Beginning in 1932, bands were invited to a parade through downtown Lincoln and to perform prior to the Homecoming football game. 700 musicians attended the event in 1932 and by 1934 it was officially known as Band Day.</p>

            <p>Don Lentz decided to re-format Band Day turning it into both a crowd pleaser that would bring visitors to the stadium and downtown Lincoln businesses and a wonderful recruiting tool for the University. He enlarged the invitation list to include all of Nebraska, not just the immediate area. 17 bands performed on the field in 1939. The show grew every year becoming more and more popular with students and fans alike. Band Day was the only sell-out game of the 1942 season. By 1947 the event was so popular that schools were limited to participation once every three years with a maximum number of musicians set at 3,600.</p>

            <p>Other conference schools soon adopted the idea and in the decade following World War II almost every college and University began to host a Band Day. At Nebraska, Band Day was a memorable event until the demand for season football tickets became so great that it was no longer possible to seat such a large number of visiting musicians. Nebraska's last Band Day was held in 1971.</p>

            <h3>"Hail Varsity"</h3>
            <p>"Hail Varsity," the official fight song for all Nebraska athletic teams, was written in 1936 by Wilber Chenoweth with words by W. Joyce Ayres. Chenoweth, a former piano and organ instructor in the School of Music, recalls the events leading to its composition:</p>

            <p>"In the early 1930s my good friend Dr. Harry Everett, a great Cornhusker fan, commissioned me to compose a new song for the University with spirit and marching capabilities. This I did during one of my semester breaks in California. As a matter of fact, I scored the song on the train returning to Lincoln. After arriving, I showed the manuscript to Joyce Ayres and suggested he write the lyrics for it."</p>

            <p>Ayres, who had several songs to his credit continues:</p>

            <p>"We worked many evenings on it, and finally satisfied ourselves to the point where we felt we could present it to the group who commissioned it. I don't know what Wilbur was paid for his efforts, but he paid me the handsome sum of five dollars for my contribution."</p>

            <p>The song was accepted and then almost forgotten, being played only sparingly for the next twelve or thirteen years.</p>

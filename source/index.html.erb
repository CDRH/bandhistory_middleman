title: Band History
---

<p class="lead">Since its formation in 1879, through multiple names and uniforms and purposes, the marching band has been about people: its leadership, members, audience, and champions. To study its history is to study the history of Lincoln, of the University, and the many people who have been a part of that history. TODO Billy Quick quote worked in here.</p>

      After years of away trips accompanied by multiple trucks to transport all of the band's equipment and instruments, the band purchased a trailer capable of carrying everything. With a beautiful exterior, the trailer also serves as an advertisement. Doug Bush, Assistant Director of Bands, remarked "It really serves a dual purpose, we haul our equipment inside, but the outside is a 'billboard' for the UNL Band Program." In 2016, the trailer was updated with a new exterior.

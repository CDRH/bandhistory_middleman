      A marching band's front ensemble, often called a "pit," is composed of musicians who do not march with their instruments. Pits may include marimbas and other mallet percussion, timpani, bass drums, tam tams, amplified (electric) instruments, and smaller percussion instruments like tambourines, cowbells, and splash cymbals.

      The band was no stranger to glockenspiels and large drums, two lyres and the five foot drum "Big Bertha" having been added to the band in 1932, but the use of that instrumentation had fallen out of use by the end of the 20th century. In 1999, with the attention of the assistant director at the time, Anthony Falcone, a front ensemble was added to the Cornhusker Marching Band which reincorporated those instruments and many more to augment the band's musical versatility.

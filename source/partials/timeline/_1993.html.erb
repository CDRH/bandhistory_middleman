      The Cornhusker Marching Band traveled to Washington, D.C. to take part in the Kennedy Center Honors event celebrating Johnny Carson, longtime host of <em>The Tonight Show</em>. Johnny Carson graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1949. TODO ask Falcone if it was 2007 (??) After Carson's death in 2005, the marching band performed a Carson halftime show in his honor.
